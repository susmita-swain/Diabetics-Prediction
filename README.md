# Diabetics-Prediction
This project focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant features.

Features:
Dataset: Include a brief description of the dataset used for training and testing the model.
Features: List the features used for prediction, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
Target: Specify the target variable (diabetes status) that the model aims to predict.
Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras (if using neural networks)
Jupyter Notebooks (or any other IDE used for development)
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

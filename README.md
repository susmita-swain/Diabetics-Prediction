# Diabetics-Prediction
This project focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data science techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant features.

Features:

Age: Age of the individual.
BMI (Body Mass Index): Body mass index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values.

Target Variable:

Diabetes Status: Binary variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras (if using neural networks)
Jupyter Notebooks (or any other IDE used for development)
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

Dataset Files:
diabetes_data.csv: The main dataset file in CSV format.

Data Preprocessing:
The data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook in the /notebooks directory covers the steps taken to clean and preprocess the dataset before training the model.

Usage:
Download or access the dataset from diabetics_data.csv.
Explore the dataset using the provided notebooks.
Use the preprocessed dataset for training and evaluating the diabetes prediction model.
